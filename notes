i think i solved fd leak problem already. obviously should test more, especially because fd number sometimes decreases actually.
( try simple pipe with two commands and then ls | ls | ls ......)

=> export a="s -la"
	l$a
should work normally.

=> command not found and pipes.

=> norme. OF COURSE



=> export | rev
